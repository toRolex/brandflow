# AI and LLM Safety Audit Prompt

Use the fuck-my-shit-mountain skill in **ai-safety mode**.

Shared setup, coverage, report template, HTML, and lint rules live in `references/report-format.md`; load that reference before producing the report.

Focus on AI/LLM application risks: prompt injection, tool authorization, RAG data leakage, model fallback, eval coverage, hallucination-sensitive workflows, and cost/abuse controls. Use this mode only when the project includes AI, LLM, agent, embedding, RAG, or model-serving behavior.

## Audit Areas

### Prompt and Instruction Boundaries
- Untrusted content is placed next to system/developer instructions without isolation.
- Retrieved documents, web pages, emails, tickets, or user files can override tool policy.
- Prompt templates concatenate role-like text or hidden directives unsafely.
- No separation between user intent, retrieved context, and execution policy.
- Sensitive instructions or chain-of-thought-like internals are exposed.

### Tool and Action Authorization
- Model output can trigger file, network, database, billing, email, or admin actions without policy checks.
- Tool arguments are trusted because they came from the model.
- Missing confirmation for irreversible or externally visible actions.
- Least-privilege scopes are not enforced per user/session/task.
- Tool results containing secrets are fed back into later prompts unnecessarily.

### RAG and Data Leakage
- Retrieval crosses tenant, account, workspace, or permission boundaries.
- Embeddings/indexes include sensitive data without deletion or access controls.
- Source attribution is missing for high-impact answers.
- Search filters are applied after retrieval instead of before.
- Cached model responses leak data across users or contexts.

### Model Reliability and Fallbacks
- Model fallback changes capability, cost, latency, or safety behavior silently.
- Outputs are used as facts without verification where correctness matters.
- JSON/function call parsing accepts malformed or partial outputs.
- No timeout, retry, or circuit breaker around model calls.
- No deterministic guardrail for safety-critical decisions.

### Evaluation and Monitoring
- No evals for prompt injection, data leakage, refusal/override, or tool misuse.
- Tests only assert happy-path text, not policy behavior.
- No logging/metrics for model errors, refusal rates, tool calls, token cost, or latency.
- No red-team corpus or regression suite for known failures.
- Production incidents cannot be traced to prompt/model/config version.

### Abuse and Cost Controls
- No rate limits, quotas, token budgets, or per-user spend tracking.
- Attackers can trigger expensive retrieval, long context, or recursive tool/model calls.
- Uploads or inputs can poison retrieval indexes.
- Moderation/safety checks are only applied after action execution.

## Rules

1. If the project has no AI/LLM surface, mark this mode Not assessed with evidence.
2. Every AI safety finding must identify attacker/user capability and the model/tool/data boundary crossed.
3. Do not rely on prompt wording alone as a security control for tool execution.
4. Prefer deterministic authorization, scoped retrieval, structured validation, evals, and budget limits.
5. Treat cross-tenant data leakage and unauthorized tool execution as High or Critical depending on blast radius.
