# Backend API Audit Prompt

Use the fuck-my-shit-mountain skill in **backend-api mode**.

Shared setup, coverage, report template, HTML, and lint rules live in `references/report-format.md`; load that reference before producing the report.

Focus on API design, request/response contracts, data access patterns, and backend data flow consistency.

## Audit Areas

### API Design Consistency
- Inconsistent naming conventions across endpoints (`/api/v1/users` vs `/api/getUsers`).
- Mixed response formats (some return `{data: ...}`, others return array directly).
- Status code misuse (200 for errors, 400 for auth failures, 500 for validation).
- Endpoints that return different shapes for success and error.
- No versioning strategy (or versioning that is not actually enforced).

### Request Validation
- Missing input validation on endpoint boundaries.
- Validation logic scattered across handlers instead of centralized.
- Type coercion happening silently (string "123" accepted as number 123).
- Required fields not enforced at the API layer (fail later in business logic).

### Authentication and Authorization
- Auth check duplicated in every handler instead of middleware.
- Mixing auth concerns with business logic.
- Endpoints that should be protected but are not.
- Token/session verification happening too late (after expensive operations).
- Hardcoded roles/permissions instead of configurable policy.

### Data Access Patterns
- N+1 queries in request handlers.
- Database queries in loops.
- Missing pagination on list endpoints.
- Inefficient loading (eager loading everything vs lazy loading vs explicit select).
- Raw queries mixed with ORM queries in the same handler.

### Cache and Invalidation
- Stale cache serving old data because invalidation is missing.
- Cache-aside vs write-through inconsistency.
- Cache keys that do not include all relevant parameters.
- Cache TTL used as a substitute for proper invalidation.

### Error Responses
- Inconsistent error response structure across endpoints.
- Error messages that leak internal implementation details.
- Generic "Internal Server Error" with no correlation ID.
- Stack traces returned to the client in non-dev modes.

### Business Logic Location
- Business rules in API handlers instead of a service/domain layer.
- Validation split between frontend, API layer, and database constraints.
- Business logic in database triggers/stored procedures.
- Logic that depends on the order of operations in a handler.

### Data Flow and Transactions
- Partial writes — some data saved, some not, on failure.
- Missing transaction boundaries for multi-step operations.
- Long-held database connections waiting on external I/O.
- Optimistic locking without retry logic.

## Rules

1. Judge API design relative to the project's scale — a 5-endpoint service does not need GraphQL.
2. Consistency is more important than "correct" design. If all endpoints use snake_case, do not recommend camelCase.
3. Missing pagination is a problem only if the dataset can grow beyond ~1000 items.
