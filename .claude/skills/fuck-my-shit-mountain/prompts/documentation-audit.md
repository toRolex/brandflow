# Documentation Audit Prompt

Use the fuck-my-shit-mountain skill in **documentation mode**.

Shared setup, coverage, report template, HTML, and lint rules live in `references/report-format.md`; load that reference before producing the report.

Focus on whether external docs, internal docs, setup instructions, and operational guidance match the code and reduce real delivery risk.

## Audit Areas

### User and Operator Documentation
- README or docs describe commands, behavior, config, or APIs that no longer match code.
- Missing setup, install, upgrade, rollback, or deployment steps.
- Missing troubleshooting guidance for known failure modes.
- Operational docs lack health checks, alert handling, backup/restore, or incident response steps.

### Developer Documentation
- No architecture overview for non-obvious module boundaries.
- Missing contribution, test, build, or local environment instructions.
- Generated code, migrations, or scripts have no safe usage notes.
- Public extension/plugin APIs lack examples and compatibility expectations.

### API and Contract Documentation
- Endpoint, CLI, event, or config docs diverge from implemented contracts.
- Error responses, status codes, and auth requirements are not documented.
- Versioning and deprecation policy is missing.
- Examples use fields or payloads that the code no longer accepts.

### Decision Records
- Major tradeoffs are implicit and hard to rediscover.
- ADRs are missing for persistence, auth, concurrency, deployment, or public API choices.
- Old decisions remain documented after the implementation changes.
- Risky constraints have no documented mitigation or owner.

### Documentation Maintenance
- Docs duplicate source-of-truth data that could be generated.
- Stale badges, version numbers, feature lists, or screenshots.
- Comments and docs disagree with each other.
- No docs check in CI for generated or schema-derived docs.

## Rules

1. Documentation findings must compare docs against actual code or release behavior.
2. Prioritize misleading docs over missing docs.
3. Do not require heavyweight docs for a small private project unless missing guidance creates real risk.
4. Prefer linking docs to generated schemas/contracts when possible.
5. Include the exact doc location and the code/config it contradicts.
